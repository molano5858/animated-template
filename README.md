# animated-template

This project is about how to incorporate animation libraries and tailwind template together. 
So IÂ´ve use tailwind-starter-kit from https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation
And incorporate animation scroll from a library: https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

I use all the knowledge to create an animated template that works from all of these resources using CDN, tailwind knowledge, etc

Here you can see the project => https://molano5858.github.io/animated-template/
